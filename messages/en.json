I dove into the world of programming upon entering university in 2023. Initially starting with a simple interest in 'making things work', through hackathons, internships, and personal projects, I awakened to the joy of 'solving someone's problems with technology' and 'providing new value experiences'. Currently, I am focusing on application development using Generative AI and modern frontend development using React/Next.js. In my university lab, I am also exploring 'AI x SE (Software Engineering)' to search for higher quality and more efficient system development methods.",
